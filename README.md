Admin panel features developed during my work at Tuzla Tasarım.

During my time at Tuzla Tasarım, I worked on multiple web projects
across different industries, developing and maintaining custom admin panels.
My responsibilities included building CMS modules, managing dynamic forms,
implementing database-driven CRUD operations, handling image and content
management, and creating SEO-focused admin tools.

I also developed English-only admin interfaces for international clients,
ensuring usability and clarity for non-Turkish users.
